### Bug Triage and Fixing
The assignment for week 11 was to read about how to triage bugs and how to fix them. The assignment also included of a exercise to find bugs in [Launchpad Bugs](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/) and pick a bug to triage it. The readings helped me to understand the process of bug triaging and how important it is. 

For the bug triage exercise I choose the bug ["calibre-debug print fails"](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/calibre/+bug/1806105). The author of the bug is wondering why calibre 3.34 fail to print a message compared to calibre 3.31. To triage this bug a question can be formed; why does calibre 3.34 fails to print a message that is printed successfully in calibre 3.31? I was able to replicate the bug. I downloaded calibre on Ubuntu and ran the command mentioned in the bug. I also recived the "SyntaxError: invalid syntax" error message.
