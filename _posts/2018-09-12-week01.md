OpenData Contribution:

This week's assignment was to contribute to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.OpenStreetMap.org). I was excited to make my first contribution in the Open Data community. In order to make my first contribution, I first learned how to navigate through the map and make changes to the map using the *iD* editor. The tutorial for the editor was straight forward, and hands on. Overall the *iD* editor isn't complex, and can be learned quickly.

In order to make my first commit to the OpenStreetMap, I decided to look up my neighborhood. I notcied that, some of the houses did not have the city and state mentioned in the address. So, I included them. Then I decided to navigate farther, and saw that the map is missing a poultry. I included the name, adress, telephone number for the poultry.After navigating farther, I saw that the map is missing mini supermarket. I decided to add a new point. I added the name, type, and telephone number, and edited the address. 

My first experience with OpenStreetMap contribution was a great one. I had a good time learning a a new tool. I had a even better time using the *iD* editior to make a contribution. Having lived in my neighborhood for 10 years, I know the place really well. So, it was a fun experience for me to find the things that were missing and add them to the map. I also felt good when I visited to
[OpenStreetMap.org](https://www.OpenStreetMap.org) the day after and saw that my changes were added to the map. Overall I enjoyed helping OpenStreetMap.org and help the Open Data community.
