___Setting Up A Project___
This week's assignment included reading about Git workflow and setting up the Open Source Projects we want to work on. Setting up the project ([Cosmos](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos)) wasn't difficult. Since, Cosmos is a library of data structures and algorithms it was pretty easy to compile and run the code. However, I did run into problems compiling the program on Windows as it uses "mingw32-make" instead of "make". There were also bash scripts to run the C++ programs. So, I cloned the repo in my Ubuntu system and was able to compile the code successfully.
