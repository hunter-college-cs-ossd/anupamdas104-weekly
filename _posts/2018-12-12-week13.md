### Group work report

This week we finished reviewing each others code. Each of us made constructive criticism about our code, and made the last changes. AFter making the changes I pushed my branch to my forked repository. And from the forked repository I made [pull request](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos/pull/3915). Inside the pull request I described the changes and mentioned the issue number. I checked the original issue and there was reference to my pull request inside the issue. Now I am waiting for them to make a comment or accept my pull request.
