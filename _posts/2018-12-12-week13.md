### About Software Licenses
__How GNU Public Licenses differ from each other:__
1. GNU General Public License(GPL): GNU GPL is a free software license and a copyleft license. There two versions of GNU GPL (3.0 and 2.0). GPL 2.0 is not compatible with GPL 3.0. However, software that were released under GPL 2.0 can use the terms later version of GPLs.
2. GNU Lesser General Public License(LGPL): is free software license but not a strong copyleft license because this software allows software to link with nonfree modules. There two versions of LGPL: LGPL 3 and LGPL 2.1. 
3. GNU Affero General Public License(AGPL): is free software license and a copyleft license. Only one version AGPL 3.0 currently exists. AGPL 3.0 is effectively similar to GPLv3, with an additional condition that allow users who interact with the licensed software over network to have the source for that program. It is recommended to use AGPL for software that will be run over a network.

__GPLs vs. Apache vs. Mozilla:__
How to distinguish betwenn GPL, Apache, and Mozilla licenses:
* _GPLs:_ GNU General Public Lincenses are free and copyleft software licenses. There are two version of GPLs: GPL 3.0 and GPL 2.0.

* _Apache:_ Apache 2.0 is compatible with GNU GPL version 3, but not compatible with GPL version 2.0 because of some patent termination and indemnification provisions. 
Apache 1.1 and Apache 1.0 are non-copyleft licenses. However Apache 1.1 has an advertising clause which makes it incompatible with GPLS. Apache 1.1 is also not compatible with GPLs.

* _Mozilla:_ Mozilla Public License (MPL) 2.0 is indirectly compatible with GNU GPL version 2.0. However there is a condition to be met in order for MPL 2.0 to be coampatible with GNU 2.0. The condition is, the files that were originally under MPL are still available under MPL's term as well. MPL 1.1 is not compatible with GPL license. 

__Copyleft:__
Copyleft is a form of licensing that allows the user to have freedom to make changes to software without converting the program into proprietary software. If someone one coverts a free software to a proprietary software, then the software loses the integrity of a free software. If Copyleft rights is enforced on a software then anyone can use, update, and release the software to the general users and keeping the software free throughout the process. 

__Permissive:__
Permissive software licenses allows programmers to disitribute software with minimal requirements. Some examples of Permissive software licenses are: the MIT License, BSD Licenses, and the Apache license. (Source:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_licence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_licence)  


__Creative Commmon Licenses:__
Creative Commom licenses allow a programmer to share their code to user and let's the the user to use, update, and modify the code. Creative Common licenses are not ideal for software because the license does not clearly specify the terms of distribution of the source code, which doesn't allow the user to have complete freedom. The Creative Common licenses also are not compatible with other major and well known licenses.

### Group work report

This week we finished reviewing each others code. Each of us made constructive criticism about our code, and made the last changes. AFter making the changes I pushed my branch to my forked repository. And from the forked repository I made [pull request](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos/pull/3915). Inside the pull request I described the changes and mentioned the issue number. I checked the original issue and there was reference to my pull request inside the issue. Now I am waiting for them to make a comment or accept my pull request.
