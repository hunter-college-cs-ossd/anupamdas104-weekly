### Group-work and Open Source Contribution Progress
This week the group work to make contributions to an open source started to pick up. Our group started to communicate over Slack and decided to split up the team in two different sub-groups(2 members per sub-group). The reason for this was that most of our team members had implemented C++ libraries before and we felt like it would be better if we divide in to groups.
