### Group-work and Open Source Contribution Progress
This week the group work to make contributions to an open source started to pick up. Our group started to communicate over Slack and decided to split up the team in two different sub-groups(2 members per sub-group). The reason for this was that most of our team members had implemented C++ libraries before and we felt like it would be better if we divide in to groups. So Amal and I decided to work on the ugly numbers problem algorithm using dynamic programming, and Liudmila and Jimmy started to work on ant-optimization problem. 

I [implemented](https://github.com/anupamdas104/cosmos/blob/Anupam/code/mathematical_algorithms/src/ugly_number/ugly_number.cpp) the algorithm to find the nth ugly number with documentation. AMal reviewed the code. And then we all looked at each others code and fixed any issues we could find.
