A Git Workflow Assignment

In my opinion this week's assignment served two purposes: 1) farther understandings of Git and Github, and 2) a preview of contributing to a project in Github. Although, I was previously familiar with Git and Github, my usage was limited to very few commands. Through this assignment, I was introduced to more functionalities and commands of Git and Github. 

This weekâ€™s assignment was more challenging compared to the previous weeks. I was a little concerned about the set up, so I needed to make sure I follow each steps correctly. All in all, this was a fun assignment, and now I am even more interested in Git and Github. I also believe that this assignment was a great simulation of contributing to an open source project. Although Open Source projects are much bigger and more challenging, this assignment gave me a better understanding of how Spen Source assignments work.
