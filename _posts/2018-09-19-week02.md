__A Wikipedia Controversy__

The article ["Running for office is hard when you have a porn star’s name. This makes it worse"](https://qz.com/1352568/running-for-office-is-hard-when-you-have-a-porn-stars-name-this-makes-it-worse/) states the struggles of Catalina Cruz, who shares a her name with a porn star, while running in a Democrat primary for a seat in the New York assembly. 

In order to clear the confusion, a Wikipedia editor, Eirka Herzog, created a Wikipedia page and disambiguation page with sufficient sources. However, the page was flagged for removal by an editor because the editor believed that Catalina did not meet the [Wikipedia notability guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability).

At first, I thought that it was unfair against Catalina and Erika. I felt like Catalina was “notable” enough because she has a good educational background, and is highly respectable in her community. And the fact that she is running for a seat New York assembly should make a her a “notable” person. I felt it was unfair because there are many Wikipedia articles for people that who seem to be less notable than Catalina. As a big fan of [Cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket), I found many Wikipedia articles for many under-19 cricket players (some of these players are: [Pinak Gosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinak_Ghosh), [Ben Lockrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Lockrose), and [Harvik Desai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvik_Desai) ). The articles for these players only contains a few lines. According to Wikipedia general notability guidelines, these players don’t qualify as notable because they don’t have “significant coverage” yet and these articles fail to address a purpose of Wikipedia notability guideline, which is to have enough coverage to write an entire article and not just a half a paragraph. However, upon more research on [Wikipedia Cricket notability guideline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Cricket#CRIN) these players qualify as notable because they all performed in a ICC Under-19 World Cup. And, since the articles are short they are labeled as a [stub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub). 
 
Then I did more research on [Wikipedia People notability guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(people)). According to the guidelines Catalina does fail to qualify as a “notable” person. She is yet to held international, national or sub-national office. Also she hasn’t received significant press coverage. However, last week [Catalina Cruz won the New York State Assembly seat](https://pix11.com/2018/09/14/__trashed-5/). 

It doesn’t sound fair to Catalina that she didn’t meet the Wikipedia notability requirements. However Wikipedia has pretty through guideline, and the editor was right to flag the Herzog’s article. Maybe Wikipedia needs to modify their notability guidelines so that people in Catalina’s situation do not face the same hurdles.
