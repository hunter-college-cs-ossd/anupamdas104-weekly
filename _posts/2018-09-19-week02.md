__A Wikipedia Controversy__

The article ["Running for office is hard when you have a porn star’s name. This makes it worse"](https://qz.com/1352568/running-for-office-is-hard-when-you-have-a-porn-stars-name-this-makes-it-worse/) states the struggles of Catalina Cruz. She shares her name with a porn star and is running in a Democrat primary for a seat in the New York Assembly. In order to clear the confusion, a Wikipedia editor, Eirka Herzog, created a Wikipedia page and disambiguation page with sufficient sources. However, the page was flagged for removal by an editor because the editor believed that Catalina did not meet the [Wikipedia notability guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability).

At first, I thought that this is unfair to Catalina and Erika. I felt like Catalina was “notable” enough because she has a good educational background and is highly respectable in her community.The fact that she is running for a seat in the New York Assembly should make a her a “notable” person. It is unfair because there are many Wikipedia articles for people that who seem to be less notable than Catalina. As a big fan of [Cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket), I found many Wikipedia articles for many under-19 Cricket players (some of these players are: [Pinak Gosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinak_Ghosh), [Ben Lockrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Lockrose), and [Harvik Desai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvik_Desai) ) who do not seem to qualify as notable. The articles for these players only contains a few lines of information. According to Wikipedia general notability guidelines, these players do not qualify as notable because they don’t have “significant coverage” yet and these articles fail to address the purpose of Wikipedia notability guideline, which requires a person "to have enough coverage to write an entire article and not just a half a paragraph". However, upon more research on [Wikipedia Cricket notability guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Cricket#CRIN) these players qualify as notable because they all performed in a ICC Under-19 World Cup. Furthermore, since the articles are short they are labeled as a [stub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub). 
 
I did more research on [Wikipedia People notability guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(people)). According to the guidelines, Catalina does fail to qualify as a “notable” person. She was yet to held international, national or sub-national office. Also she has not received significant press coverage. However, last week [Catalina Cruz won the New York State Assembly seat](https://pix11.com/2018/09/14/__trashed-5/). 

It does not sound fair to Catalina that she did not meet the Wikipedia notability requirements. However Wikipedia has pretty thorough guidelines, and Herzog’s article was flagged because it failed to meet those guidelines. Maybe Wikipedia needs to modify their notability guidelines so that people in Catalina’s situation do not face the same hurdles.
