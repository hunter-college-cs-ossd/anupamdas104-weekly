__A Wikipedia Controversy__

The article ["Running for office is hard when you have a porn star’s name. This makes it worse"](https://qz.com/1352568/running-for-office-is-hard-when-you-have-a-porn-stars-name-this-makes-it-worse/) states the struggles of Catalina Cruz, a Democratic politician who shares her name with a porn star, and is also running in the primary election for a seat in the New York Assembly. In order to clear up the confusion, a Wikipedia editor, Erika Herzog, created a Wikipedia page and a disambiguation page with sufficient sources. However, the page was flagged for removal by an editor because the editor believed that Catalina did not meet the [Wikipedia notability guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability).

At first, I thought that it was unfair to Catalina and Erika. I felt like Catalina was “notable” enough because she had a good educational background and was highly respectable in her community. And the fact that she is running for a seat in New York Assembly should make her a “notable” person. It is unfair because there are many Wikipedia articles for people who seem to be less notable than Catalina. As a big fan of [cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket), I found many Wikipedia articles for many under-19 cricket players (some of these players are: [Pinak Gosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinak_Ghosh), [Ben Lockrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Lockrose), and [Harvik Desai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvik_Desai)) who don't seem to qualify as notable. The articles for these players only contain a few lines. According to Wikipedia general notability guidelines, these players don’t qualify as notable because they don’t have “significant coverage” yet, and these articles fail to meet one of the Wikipedia notability guidelines, which is "to have enough coverage to write an entire article and not just a half a paragraph." However, upon more research on [Wikipedia cricket notability guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Cricket#CRIN), these players qualify as notable because they all performed in a ICC Under-19 World Cup. Additionally, since the articles are short, they are labeled as a [stub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub). 
 
Then, I did more research on [Wikipedia People notability guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(people)). According to the guidelines, Catalina does fail to qualify as a “notable” person. She had yet to hold international, national or sub-national office. Also, she hasn’t received significant press coverage. However, last week [Catalina Cruz won the New York State Assembly seat](https://pix11.com/2018/09/14/__trashed-5/). 

It doesn’t sound fair to Catalina that she didn’t meet the Wikipedia notability requirements. However, Wikipedia has pretty thorough guidelines, and Herzog’s article was flagged because it failed to meet those guidelines. Maybe Wikipedia needs to modify their notability guidelines so that people in Catalina’s situation do not face the same hurdles.
