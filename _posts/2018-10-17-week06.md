__A Second Git Workflow Exercise__

This week's assignment involved working on another Git project in groups. The purpose of this assignment was to generate multiple pull requests, and handle merge conflict. I really enjoyed this assignment and found this project to be easier than the other Git assignments. I believe that is because the other git assignments helped me prepare for it. However, this assignment is very cruical as we get to tackle how to handle merge conflict.
