### An Introduction to Git

For this week, we were introduced to collaborative editing using Git and [GitHub](https://github.com/).  It was a good transition from last week’s work. At first, the assignment looked a bit intimidating, but after reading the instructions multiple times it became more clear. Thus far this was the most challenging assignment.

This assignment required us to contact with other team members so that we can avoid merge conflict. Since grammar is not one of my strongest suit, correcting my team member’s grammar was challenging. I had to read their posts multiple times to be sure that I am making the correct changes.  Editing their posts and merging their changes to my master branch via Git and GitHub was also challenging but learning more about these technologies were more fun.
