### Bugtracker excercise

The requirement for this week's assignment was to explore [GNOME Accessibility Bugs.](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=GNOME%20Accessibility%20Bugs) The purpose of this week's assignment was to get us famaliarized with the Bugzilla bug tracker. The Bugzilla bug tracker provides a lot of reseources to work on the bugs. The list of bugs also can be sorted various ways. We were asked to write up a through report on the Bugzilla tracker. My favorite part of the assignment was to choose a bug from the list and find out more about it. This helped me to better understand how to pick a bug to work on and how to get started. All in all this week's assignemnt was great excercise for us to learn more about bug trackers and finding a bug to work on.
