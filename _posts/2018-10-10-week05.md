### Readings On Open Source, Part 2

This week's assignment involved more readings about Open Source, and they focused mainly on the ways one can contribute to a Open Source project, and communicate with the members of a project. I really enjoyed [A Beginnerâ€™s Very Bumpy Journey Through The World of Open Source](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-beginners-very-bumpy-journey-through-the-world-of-open-source-4d108d540b39). The author of this article ([Shubheksha](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/@shubheksha)) described the obstacles she has faced in the Open Source community when she first started. Then she go onto talk about how she overcame those obstacles and get the best out of contributing in a Open Source project. 

The main reason I find this article interesting is that I can relate with her fears when she first started to contribute in Open Source. This article and [How to Contribute to Open Source Without Coding](https://icontribute.wordpress.com/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-without-coding/) states that there are many ways to contribute to Open Source projects other than coding. All of the readings this week helped me get a better idea of how to start making significant contributions to a Open Source Project.
